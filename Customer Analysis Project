This project is based on the Customer Analyis done by the company to check wheather their customers are using the Mobile app more or Website more.
This also includes the yearly investment of the company on both platform.
We can clearly see this a linear regression problem with 2 Matrix of Features and 1 Dependent Vector.
For this project i have used Numpy,Matplotlib,pandas and seaborn as libraries for numerical calculation and visualization.
Then i checked my dataset. As this a machine generated dataset, it doesn't contain any null values.
Then i caried all the exploratory analysis using seaborn.
Then i splitted my dataset on training set and test set.
Trained my model on the training set.
Predicted new values using the test set.
Then visualized the test set and the predicted Values.
Then Evaluated my model in the test set and got the r2_score.
This project is just the beginning towards Machine Learning.
Thank you for reading and checking my code. 
Feel free to give any suggestion in my linkedin profile.
