# Machine-Learning-Projects
i am a beginner in the field of machine learning. Here i post projects done by me.
This is my first machine learning Project.
Here i trained a simple Linear Regression Model.
I divided the dataset into training set and test set.
The Model is trained on the training set. 
The Visualization and prediction are made on the test set.
At the end i estimated my model performance and it was quite good.
Looking forward for more projects on machine learning
Thank you and Enjoy Machine Learning.
