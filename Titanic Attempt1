This is my first attempt on this Titanic dataset which was taken from Kaggle Website. This is a Logistic Regression Model where I have performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) with dealing with maximum null values. Here I have taken (Sex and Age) as the Matrix of feature and (Survived) as Dependent Vector. I have taken mean values in the age column to deal with the null values and made use of seaborn for the EDA. At last, I have evaluated my model which gave a score of 78% which is not so good. In my next attempt, I will try to make it to 90%. Thank you for your time.
