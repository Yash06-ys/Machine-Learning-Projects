This project is based on classification where we have to specify based on the given feature the flower belongs to which species. For this model I have made use of three classification techniques such as Decision Tree, KNN and Logistics. The Initial steps are same for data pre-process and EDA. No null values where present in the dataset. Some relational EDA has been made to make useful insight and at last evaluated the model accuracy.
Then I have divided the dataset in x and y where I have included all the features in x and dependent vector in y. As we have string values in our y, we have to apply label encoding to convert in numeric value. Then I have divided my x and y into training set and test set. 
Then I have trained Decision Tree model and displayed my training set accuracy which was 100% and test set accuracy which is 97%. Then evaluating my Decision Tree model I got an accuracy of 96.6%.
Second model was Logistic Regression where I got my training set accuracy of 100%, test set result 97% and model accuracy 96.6%.
Third model was KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor) where I got my training set accuracy of 100%, test set result 97% and model accuracy of 96.6%.
Overall our classification model was pretty amazing in its predictions and its accuracy. 

Thank you for reading this. Have a Good Day.
